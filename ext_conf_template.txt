# cat=basic//; type=boolean; label=Disable HTTPS check: Check this box if you want to enable the extension if the connection to the backend is not secured with https. Warning: You usually do not want to enable this checkbox for security reasons. All master passwords (passphrase for private keys) will be sent in plain text to the backend and might be easily catched with a man-in-the-middle attack. You probably only want to disable this check if you are running TYPO3 on localhost with http. DO NOT use this extension in a non https enabled internet environment.
